# SignalR Real-Time Communication Example Solution
This example solution demonstrates how to build real-time communication in .NET web applications using SignalR. The solution contains three projects:

- Server Hub: A .NET Web API project that serves as the server hub for real-time communication.
- Client Console App: A .NET Console application that acts as the client for real-time communication with the server hub.
- Shared Model Library: A .NET Class Library that contains the shared model for communication between the server hub and the client.
